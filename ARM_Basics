* RISC based architecture.
* Reduced Instruction Set Computer. It is a type of microprocessor architecture that uses a small set of instructions 
  of uniform length. These are simple instructions which are generally executed in one clock cycle. More registers needed
* ARM stands for Advanced RISC Machine
* 32-bit architecture
  * 32-bit Arm architecture, such as Armv7-A 
  * CPU modes: User mode, FIQ mode, IRQ mode, Supervisor (svc) mode,
  * Instruction set: Uniform 16 Ã— 32-bit register file, single clock-cycle execution, Fixed instruction width of 32 bits to 
    ease decoding and pipelining, at the cost of decreased code density.
    * Arithmetic instructions
    * Registers: R13 is also referred to as SP, the Stack Pointer.
      R14 is also referred to as LR, the Link Register.
      R15 is also referred to as PC, the Program Counter.
    * Conditional execution:
   * Pipelines: The Arm7 and earlier implementations have a three-stage pipeline; the stages being fetch, decode and execute. 
      Higher-performance designs, such as the Arm9, have deeper pipelines: Cortex-A8 has thirteen stages.
